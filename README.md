**<span id="up" style="color:red">RED</span>ACTOR** is a cozy Juputer Notebook created by [Bilinguator.com](https://bilinguator.com/) to make texts cleaner. It may help to place quotation marks, parentheses, dashes, ellipses in the desired format, remove unnecessary line breaks or page numbers, find and tag titles and character names.

It is created to preprocess texts according to [aligned text specification](https://github.com/bilinguator/aligned-texts#aligned-text-files-specification) used in the [Bilinguator.com](https://bilinguator.com/) library. Nevertheless, there are more or less universal functions that could be helpful in work with any possible texts.

The entire description of all available steps are in the [redactor.ipynb](redactor.ipynb) notebook. Use the `Contents` section, `Up` and `Save text` links to navigate over the document.

The [Ёditor](https://github.com/bilinguator/yoditor) tool must be pluged in to dot the `Ё` letters in Russian texts.
